# LazyCollection

A minimal SwiftUI lazy container type, that:

* uses `UICollectionView` underneath and supports any self-sizing `UICollectionViewLayout` you throwing at it;
* can be used on iOS 13.0+ and substituted the sometimes wonky `LazyVStack`; and
* does not support sections as is.

There is no commitment to a feature roadmap. Feel free to copy & paste into your own codebase, and evolve/fork it on your own terms.
